    <h1>Andrew Ross Sorkin,author of <i>Too Big to Fail</i></h1>

    <img src="../images/Andrew ross sorkin.jpg">
    <p>New York Times columnist and author,Andrew Ross Sorkin,has been described as &quot;the most
       famous financial journalist of his generation.&quot;His book,<i>Too Big To Fail</i>,was the first
       behind-the-scenes account of the financial crisis that led to our current recession.</p>
    <p>The Economics,The Financial Times,and Business Week all named <i>Too Big To Fail</i> one of 
       the best books of the year.The book was published by Viking October 20,2009.The book 
       was adapted as a movie by HBO Films and premiered on HBO on May 23,2011.</p>

    <h1>Movie reviews</h1>
    <div id="para1">
    <p>&quot;Lots of heat but not very much light.It came across as a kind of daytime soap 
        version showing the personalities of the players rather than dealing with the nuts 
        and bolts of what really happened.Even that would not have been so bad but the movie
        tries to portray lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do the 
        right thing.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;I am watching this for the 3rd time,trying to understand how this large group of
        capitalist pigs could royally screw their families,descendants,neighbors,countrymen 
        and the rest of the whole world with absolutely no compassion.&quot;</p>
